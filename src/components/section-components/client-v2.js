					  We all have choices on where we spend our hard earned money. In America, most people get very limited vacation time and when you've been saving all year for that one or two week vacation with your family you have the right to expect to be taken care of. Elevations takes care of you. In fact, in my experience Elevations goes above and beyond to always cater to the needs of their customers so their guests can have one less thing to worry about when they finally have free time to relax with family and friends.

					  During my business travel days, if I were visiting a city Iâ€™ve never been to and have no idea as to the safety or the cleanliness I would always choose a Elevations Hotel. Why? Because could always be assured that the sheets on the bed were changed. There was always a restaurant either in the Hotel or next door, their safety procedures are superior.
